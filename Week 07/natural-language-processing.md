## What is Natural Language Processing(NLP)?
Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written referred to as natural language. 

NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence which enables computers to comprehend, analyse, and modify human language. To bridge the gap between human communication and machine comprehension, NLP depends on a variety of academic fields, including computer science and computational linguistics.

## Applications of NLP
#### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Given that people frequently utilise sarcasm and irony, interpreting natural language in the context of opinions is extremely challenging for robots. Sentiment analysis, on the other hand, may spot small variations in emotions and attitudes and assess their positivity or negativity.

#### 2. Text Classification
Automatically comprehending, analysing, and classifying unstructured text is the task of text classification, a text analysis problem that also incorporates sentiment analysis.

#### 3. Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
NLP is how voice assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, can understand and respond to human speech and perform tasks based on voice commands. NLP is the driving technology that allows machines to understand and interact with human speech, but is not limited to voice interactions.

#### 4. Text Extraction
NLP can be used to transform the free (unstructured) text in documents and databases into normalized, structured data suitable for analysis or to drive machine learning (ML) algorithms.

#### 5. Text Summarization
The concept of automatic summarization is quite clear. It provides a text summary by highlighting the key points. Its major objective is to make it easier to browse through massive volumes of data, including scientific publications, news articles, and legal documents.

#### 6. Machine Translation
NLP makes the computer system use, interpret, and understand human languages and verbal speech, such as English, German, or another 'natural language'.

#### 7. Market Intelligence
NLP is often used to gain a qualitative understanding of the “why” and “what” of a situation, and enables users to make more insightful decisions. In Marketing Analytics, NLP can be used to understand your audience's intentions so that you can create smarter, more efficient marketing strategies.

#### 8. Auto-Correct
Natural Language Processing plays a vital role in grammar checking software and auto-correct functions. Tools like Grammarly, for example, use NLP to help you improve your writing, by detecting grammar, spelling, or sentence structure errors.

#### 9. Speech Recognition
NLP helps computers learn, understand, and produce content in human or natural language. Text/character recognition and speech/voice recognition are capable of inputting the information in the system, and NLP helps these applications make sense of this information.

## Components of NLP

#### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
Computers can quickly and automatically evaluate data using natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning, saving organisations precious hours and resources when reviewing vast amounts of client input.
- Syntatic ambiguity
- Semantic ambiguity
- Pragmatic ambiguity

#### Natural Language Generation (NLG)
NLG, or natural language generation, is an artificial intelligence-driven software process that creates natural written or spoken language from organised and unstructured data. Computers can communicate with users more effectively if they do so in human rather than computer language. Natural Language Generation technology is enabled through a range of computer science processes. These include:

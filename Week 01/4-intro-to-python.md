# Introduction to Python

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level, dynamically semantic programming language. It is particularly desirable for Rapid Application Development as well as for usage as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components together due to its high-level built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding.

```python
print('Hello, world!')
```

## Variables and Data Types

**Variables** are used for storing data values like numbers, strings, list, tuple, and dictionary.

* **Integers** are used to represent whole number values.
* **Float** data type is used to represent decimal point values.
* **Boolean** is used for categorical output since the output is either True or False.
* **Strings** can be any character or number enclosed in single or double quotations. 
    - We can apply mathematical operators like $+$ and $\times$ on strings.
    - Strings are immutable in nature.
* **Lists** are ordered and changeable, unlike strings and are very similar to arrays. Lists can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as we add.
    - `append()` adds an element at the end of the list
    - `clear()` removes all the elements from the list
    - `copy()` returns a copy of the list
    - `count()` returns the number of specified elements 
    - `extend()` adds the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
    - `index()` returns the index of the first element with the specified value
    - `insert()` adds an element at the specified position
    - `pop()` removes the element at the specified position
    - `remove()` removes the first item at the specified index/position
    - `reverse()` reverses the order of the list
    - `sort()` sorts the list in a particular order
